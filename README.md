# SuperNotMario
 
 Trust me. It's not Mario.

Description:
The game I am creating is definitely not Super Mario Brothers. You will play as a two-dimensional character who can go from the start to the end of a level defeating ambiguously designed enemies. You cannot collect “Coins”, you hit yellow boxes to collect “Money”. Grab as much money as you can! Only a true super player can collect all 12 coins! But not super like Super Mario, super like great. Please do not tell Nintendo.

**Controls:**

WASD – Move

Left Shift – Run

Space – Jump

Enter – Pause Game

**All code is my own.** I think you'll be able to tell.

_Please enjoy._
